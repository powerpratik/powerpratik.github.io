# Introducing Zed

Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor created by the team behind Atom and Tree-sitter. It is designed to provide a productive and unobtrusive coding experience, combining the power of an IDE with the responsiveness of a lightweight editor.
### Fun Fact: This blog is written in zed using the gpt support. With Natural language and not code of course :) 

## Open Source and High Performance

Zed is open source and engineered for performance, leveraging every CPU core and the GPU to start instantly, load files quickly, and respond to keystrokes without lag. It maintains a full syntax tree for every buffer, enabling precise code highlighting, auto-indent, a searchable outline view, and structural selection.

## Language Server Protocol and Terminal Integration

Zed supports the Language Server Protocol for autocompletion, code navigation, diagnostics, and refactorings. The editor integrates a full-featured terminal, and it supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple developers to navigate and edit within a shared workspace.

## Cutting-Edge GUI with GPUI Framework

Zed's GUI is built using its GPUI framework, which rasterizes the entire window on the GPU for fast and reliable delivery of pixels on every frame. The editor is designed for the multi-core era, using Rust's unique type system to parallelize work across multiple cores without compromising application stability.

## AI Integration and Vim Mode

Zed has an integrated assistant panel that allows users to interact conversationally with AI models like GitHub Copilot and GPT-4 to generate or refactor code. The editor also features Vim mode, various light and dark themes, and extensive fuzz testing for stability.

## A Focus on Collaboration and Quality

Zed is described as an elegant and distraction-free tool that provides a calming and focused coding environment. It is also designed to support real-time collaboration and aims to make conversations about code happen close to the code itself.

## Zed Industries' Vision

The editor's creators have a vision of building the world's best text editor that is handcrafted with unparalleled attention to detail and provides a shared software development experience. Zed Industries, the team behind Zed, believes in creating hyper-responsive mission-critical tools and promoting real-time collaboration to produce better software. They also believe that joyful coding starts with an editor that stays out of your way.
